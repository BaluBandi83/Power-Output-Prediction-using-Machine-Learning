        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            The Combined Cycle Power Plant or combined cycle gas turbine, a gas turbine generator generates electricity and waste heat is used to make steam to generate additional electricity via a steam turbine...
        </p>
        <p>
            More recently, as simple cycle efficiencies have improved and as natural gas prices have fallen, gas turbines have been more widely adopted for base load power generation...

        <p>
            The basic principle of the Combined Cycle is simple: burning gas in a gas turbine produces not only power, but also fairly hot exhaust gases. Routing these gases through a heat exchanger produces steam...
